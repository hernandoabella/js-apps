## 📌 Users should be able to:

- View the menu items or plates on the left side of the screen and add them to your cart on the right side.
- When there are no menu items in your cart, you should see a message that says, "Your cart is empty."
- When a plate is added to your cart, the Subtotal and Totals will automatically update.
- When products are in your cart, you should be able to increase and decrease the quantity.
- A user should not be able to mark the quantity as a negative number.
- If the quantity goes down to 0, the user will have the option to delete or remove the product from their cart entirely.
- Tax is based on the state of Tennessee sales tax: 0.0975
- After the user refreshes the page, they should still have the dishes added to their cart.
