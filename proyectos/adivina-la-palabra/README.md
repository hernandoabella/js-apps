### [Link to App](http://matthewemichael.github.io/word-guess-game/index.html)

### Overview

This is the third assignment for the Vanderbilt University Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we created one of two possible computer games: Word Guess or Psychic. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.

### Requirements

* App must suit these basic specs:
  * Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!
  * Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
  * Display the following on the page:
    * Press any key to get started!
    * Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
    * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.
    * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.
    * Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
    * Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).
  * After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

### Additional Features

* None of the guessing words will be repeated during a game.
* To add diffuculty, the number of guesses changes based on word length.
* Plays different sounds at the end of the game - one to congratulate a winner, one to taunt a loser and an easter egg of sorts if a player can manage to guess every single word in the game.
